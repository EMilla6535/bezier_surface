<h1>Bezier Surface</h1>
<h2>Blender add on to create a surface from 4 connected and closed bezier curves</h2>
<p>This simple add-on creates 4 simple connected Bézier curves that could be modified to fit a complex surface.<br>
I developed it as an alternative to Nurbs Surface.</p>
<p>Note: 2.75b version is outdated but preserved for documentation.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Download and install 3.4 version.</li>
    <li>After installing there will be a new option on Add > Mesh > Surface Border.</li>
    <li>The Surface Border option creates four connected Bézier curves that you can edit.</li>
    <li>To convert it into a surface go to Object > Bezier Surface (it could be at the end of the options),<br>
    or Context Menu(by default key N) > Tool > Bezier Surface.<br>
    A new object will be created preserving the border.</li>
    <li>There will be a floating panel where you can choose the number of subdivisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The operator only works if it's a curve with only 1 spline and 4 points.<br>
Final result may be difficult to visualize.</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
    <li>More options for personalization and easy access.</li>
    <li>Improvements to allow more subdivisions.</li>
    <li>Visualization of the resulting surface while editing.</li>
</ul>
